# Pentaho Data Integratation
ETL tool that uses a combination of Transformations and Jobs. Transformations describe a continous flow of rows being piped from one node to another using "hops" that will run indefinitely until all data is consumed. Jobs on the other hand are a combination of transformations and other jobs that describe the flow of the ETL.
